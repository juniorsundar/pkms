* To-Do

** (-) HITL simulation and data collection for system latency

*** (-) Collect data and compile it for analysis

    Wrote a data converter and compiler according to the needs of the final
    data set. Processing is still needed for this, though that can be done at a
    later date.

    Ready to move on to the HITL setup, since things are working well in SITL.
    Of course, the issue of whether faults injected will become evident in the
    data is a question. But as per Yashrajsinh, it shouldn't matter as long as
    the deviations are being captured.

** (-) #RESEARCH Tasks

*** (-) Is it possible to automate ROS node generation

** (-) Dronsole groundwork

*** (-) Test out method suggested by Ilkka to run `kubectl` commands directly

*** (-) Explore the DataHub method for obtaining data

**** (-) Syncup with Moamen as well

** (-) Prepare logistics for updating tasks and goal given the meeting with Willian 

*** (-) #BRAINSTORM Data generation for publication

**** (-) Literature review

     > Is there a shortage in this field?
     > Are there any existing solutions to this shortage?
     > How are datasets usually framed in this context?
