* To-Do

** -(_) #PERSONAL Implement a basic ROS 2 implementation for swarm controls for Saurabh to test his algorithms-

** (-) Update Jira

*** (x) RTA-20: Redefine RTA-70 to reflect new objective

**** (x) Indicate that the previous sub-tasks are carrying over

**** (x) Write comments to explain why changes were made

*** (x) RTA-354: Expound on RTA-67/RTA-68 to reflect new objectives

*** (-) RTA-22: Reorient for swarm

**** (x) Discuss with Saurabh to identify swarm requirements

     *Communication mode*
     Many-to-many. Basically, each drone should be able to communicate with
     other nodes in the swarm. An obfuscation layer/mask can be written atop
     this that can handle the emulation of distance based signal strength, etc.

     *Swarm behaviour*
     Basic swarm behaviour in play. Given a random spawn of points and a path,
     drones need to maintain safe distance away from each other and continually
     move towards a specific goal. Additionally a move towards centroid can
     also be implemented.

     *Swarm size*
     five to ten drones.

     *Connectivity*
     This needs some thought. So one idea was to have a sort of distributed
     connectivity matrix that can help the drones in swarm understand when they
     need to enter RTA mode. For instance, in a scenario with drones A, B, C
     and D. If C connected to B is disconnected, then how does the information
     of this propagate through the entire swarm? /some thoughts here/

    | SRTA-AD
    | | Junior Sundar
    | | Martin Andreoni
    | | Willian Lunardi

*** Goals

    Disseminate and update

*** Agenda

    - (x) Updates sent down from above
    - (x) Updates from below

*** Minutes

    /Martin Andreoni/
    - RTA-presentation next week (introducing the SRTA)
    - Ticky interested with Generation AI application in SRTA context
       -- Dynamic UTM with LLMs?

    /Abdulrahman Ba Nabila/
    > Generative AI models minimise the distance between the distributions. It
    > is primarily applicable in the context of unsupervised learning.

    /Junior Sundar/
    - Still in datagen for HITL
    - Adjusted Jira to reflect pivot from previous meeting
    - Data gen will be local
       -- Is it even necessary if the goal is to generate the diverse dataset?
    - Try to see if it is possible to set up HITL with Saluki V3
