* Meetings

** SRTA / Testing Team - Data Collection Discussion

*** Attendees

    | Junior Sundar
    | Willian Lunardi
    | Martin Andreoni
    | Jose Segovia

*** Goal

    Follow up on earlier meeting where I wasn't present, about the data
    collection and accumulation strategy

*** Agenda

    - Check how and what data can be collected
    - Identify ways in which SRTA team can coordinate with Testing Team to get
      the required data sets

*** Minutes

    9 features of which 2 are being demo'd for Q2 (June)

    Single drone data collection is all that is required (not swarm)

    Possible to schedule a workshop to teach drone flight and data collection
    process

    Fleet is of non-homogeneous frames

    Current Testing Team strategy is not standardised or logged properly

    Some failures can occur in which the sensor cannot detect the failure
    happening like spontaneous disconnection of FC power supply due to
    excessive vibrations

    Brought up the point of `SDLOG_PROFILE` and data collection in FIFO. It
    seems that it is possible but some discussion needs to take place for this.
