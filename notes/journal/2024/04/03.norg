    MLFlow server working in cloud.

    Template for SRTA modules need to be updated or modded in a case-by-case
    basis.

    `fog-hyper` manifests will be used for RTA deployment -- people need to be
    made accustomed to it.

    Do we need to add Jetson into the existing tailnet?

    How to demo safe-landing use case?
    - 2 mechanisms: from SRTA or from FMO through UI-Dashboard.
    - Plugin will output safe-landing coordinates every n-intervals.

    Dashboard concept is ready:
    - Fixed-wing + VTOL is coming out soon.
    - Front end team is fully booked.
    - Notifications + messages working.
    - Implementation can only be started from next week.

    Demo preparation should be added to Jira
    - Already integrated into existing stories.
    - Would also help visibility to add it as a separate story.

    FMO and SRTA, how will it all come together?

    Safety dashboard only applies to SRTA not LLM or anything like that.

*** Action Items

    No actionable items this time.
