* To-Do

  - (-) Flash custom firmware into Saluki V2
     -- (x) Touch base with Yashraj to determine what is needed from the HiTL
     -- (-) Set up simulation in HITL for data collection
     -- ( ) Collect data
  - ( ) #RESEARCH Is it possible to automate ROS node generation.
  - ( ) #RESEARCH "Rule-Based Decision Engine"
  - (-) Try dumping the fault data as {https://github.com/foxglove/mcap}[MCAP]
  - (-) Dronsole groundwork
     -- (x) Investigate process to reset drone at failure. Check {:$/journal/2024/02/22:* Fault Injection UI and Swarm Controls}[here]
     -- (x) Investigate the strategy to send waypoints through the NATS topic
            for path worker
     -- ( ) Test the DataHub method for obtaining data
        --- ( ) Syncup with Moamen as well
     -- (-) Continue discussion with Miika to properly understand the
            redeployment procedure
     -- ( ) Syncup with Ilkka for the swarm NATS implementation
  - (-) Plan for Fault Injector Interface
  - (!) 28 February, Prepare items for the Saluki V3 Demo

* Journal

  - Discussed with Ilkka about what is and isn't possible. Check {* Requirements for Dronsole Integration}[below].
  - Met with Yashrajsinh to clarify scope of HITL. {* Requirements for HITL Data Collection}[Check below].
  - Started talks with Miika to understand how to reset simulation.
  - Submitted timesheet

* Requirements for HITL Data Collection

** Review of Meeting

   - Drone is running
      -- In Hover mode
      -- Take one test in Path mode
   - Recording topics (refer to PPT)
      -- Timestamped and only pertinent data required
   - Fault activation
      -- All 5 sensors
      -- negative $\infty$ -- 0 -- positive $\infty$ 
   - Run till failure or set time point
      -- Failure defined by crash, sudden landing, out of bounds
      -- Out of bounds in 2 levels: unacceptable, and failure (1m, 5m)
   - Dump data for analysis

** Plan of Action

   - First have to change the scripts in `simulation_manager.py`
      -- Since it is a hardware in the loop launch, it needs to kill jMavSim
      -- Identify how it interacts with the QGroundControl (is it even needed?)
      -- Only needs to kill the simulation, as I can manage the clean relaunch by myself (for now)
   - The mission is only to launch and hover, so activate `commander takeoff` manually
   - Activate data recording and fault timers with a single command
      -- Need to rework the `fault_manager.py` as well as `sensor_recorder_unsync.py`

* Requirements for Dronsole Integration

  -  Ability to forward shell commands without having to attach to the dronsole shell
     -- This is not possible yet in dronsole.
     -- Refer {:$/journal/2024/02/26:* Implementing a Shell Command Forwarding Process in Dronsole}[here] for possible implementation strategy.
     -- Can do `kubectl exec` directly if the computer has the token to connect
        directly to the platform instead of through dronsole commands.
     -- ^*Hasn't yet been implemented.*^

  - Being able to reset the drone at failure
     -- Not possible to simply reset the Gazebo model, as the PX4 controller
        does not update
     -- Not possible to just relaunch the px4-sitl container as the
        fog-navigation container breaks
     -- ^*As of now, there isn't a valid way to reset drone at failure.*^
     -- Contact Miika for simulation relaunch.
        --- One way is to remove the simulation completely and recreate it <- ^How?^
        --- Other way would be to scale all of the px4 deployments to 0 and
            then restarting the Gazebo simulation container. After than the px4
            containers can be scaled back to 1.

  - Being able to send waypoints through shell commands for path worker without UI
     -- Need `nats-cli` installed locally, and the NATS port being forwarded.
  @code bash
  did=beta
  mid=${1:-$(uuidgen)}

  read -p "Press enter to setup mission"

  nats pub mission.path.$mid.events.$did '{"type":"PathSet", "body":{"path":[{"lat":47.39806354374117,"lon":8.54524089303674,"alt":5},{"lat":47.39725378459287,"lon":8.544945850049395,"alt":5}]}}'

  read -p "Press enter to activate"

  nats request mission.path.$mid.request.activate.$did ''

  read -p "Press enter to start mission"

  nats pub mission.path.$mid.commands '{"type":"StartMission"}'
