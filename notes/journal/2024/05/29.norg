* To-Do

** (_) Test flight mission at 6AM {@ Wednesday 29 May 2024} 
   - The GCS isn't communicating with the drone so cannot control autonomous
     missions with fog-system
   - QGC still works. Tie this in with --> {:$/journal/2024/05/30:** Drone Control for Autonomous Missions}[Drone Control for Autonomous Missions]

* Journal

  - Attended {** Solita - SRTA MLOps Syncup}[Solita - SRTA MLOps Syncup].
  - Attended {** RTA Meeting}[RTA Meeting].

  ===

* w.r.t. October (GITEX 2024) Demo

** Discussion

   - Need to create a demo for GITEX to showcase the work done in SRTA
   - Need to decide on a robotic platform (/Possible UGV/)
      -- {:$/journal/2024/06/03:** Check out whether F4F has UGV that we can use}[Check out whether F4F has UGV that we can use]
   - Need to find a strategy that is adjacent enough to the current platform
     such that the amount of changes that need to be made in the code/framework
     is limited.

** Demonstrable Items

   - in Hardware:
      -- Authentication/Authorisation
         --- voice recognistion,
         --- text-2-speech,
         --- LLM,
         --- API to convert textual commands to robotics commands.
   - Parasitic load
      -- Place load or some opposition on object and warning is produced.
   - in Virtual/Simulation:
      -- Drone + Jammer virtual demonstration
         --- Person designates jam region on screen
         --- Drone visually deploy the geofence
         --- Drones avoid this geofence
   - Mission success forecast
      -- Place waypoints and forecast is shown.
      -- Change waypoints and it gets updated.

* Meetings

** Solita - SRTA MLOps Syncup

*** Attendees

    | SRTA-AD
    | Solita

*** Goals

    - Update for demo
    - State of MLOps and SRTA module deployments

*** Agenda

    - Up to speed on the state of development of SRTA modules and such.
    - Synchronise on deliverables for the demo.

*** Minutes

    Emergency landing demo is functional.
    - End to end container works with segmentation models.
    - Set minimum battery value via PX4 container to display the pop-up on the
      UI

    Unsure if gstreamer/deepstream will work with GHAF 2.0

    Demo status -> Some minor bug fixes left

    Intended integration date will happen after SLS completion

    - How to test sensor anomalies in simulation?
    - Focus on data transformation from rostopics over data injection.

*** Action Points

    MAYBE Set up meeting with Willian and Samridha to talk about the nature of
    template structure.

** RTA Meeting

*** Attendees

    | SRTA-AD

*** Goals

    - Update for demo

*** Agenda

    - Discuss progress on hold-out on physical demonstration.

*** Minutes

    Moved as JIRA tasks in the SYSTEST team, so it is now in progress.
    - The main points have been clarified with John.
    - Get drone airborne --> {:$/journal/2024/05/28:* Journal}[w.r.t. Drone Flights]

    {* w.r.t. October (GITEX 2024) Demo}[Gitex needs to be discussed at a later time]

*** Action Points

    - {** Test flight mission at 6AM {@ Wednesday 29 May 2024}}
