* Key Terms

** Barrier Functions

*** Purpose

    Barrier functions are designed to penalise or discourage solutions that
    violate constraints. They are used in constrained optimsation problems,
    where certain conditions must be satisfied by the solution.

*** How it works

    In essence, a barrier funciton incorporates constraints of optimisation
    problem into objective function. This is done by adding a *penalty term* to
    the objective function that *becomes large as the solution approaches the
    boundary* of the feasible region defined by the constraints.

*** Advantages and Disadvantages

    Barrier functions allow for the conversion of a *constrained problem* into
    an *unconstrained* one, simplifying the optimization process.

    However, the choice of barrier function and its parameters can
    significantly impact the convergence and performance of the optimization
    algorithm.

*** Types

    > Given the case of objective $f(x)$ with constraints $|g_i (x) \leq 0|$
    > for $i=1, ..., m$

    The barrier adds a term to the objective function. The purpose is for the
    barrier function to grow as the function approaches the constraint
    boundary.

    ~ *Linear Barrier Function*:
      $|F(x, c) = f(x) + \frac{1}{c} \Sigma_{m}^{i+1} \text{max}(0, g_i(x))|$
    ~ *Quadratic Barrier Function*:
      $|F(x, c) = f(x) + \frac{1}{c^2} \Sigma_{m}^{i+1} \text{max}(0, g_i(x))|$
    ~ *Logarithmic Barrier Function*:
      $|F(x, c) = f(x) + -1 \Sigma_{m}^{i+1} ln(-g_i(x))|$

*** Examples

    *Logarithmic barrier functions*:

    Consider the optimisation problem:

    > Minimise $|f(x) = x^2 \in x \geq 1|$

    Here the constraint can be rewritten as $|g(x) = 1 - x \leq 0|$

    By applying a logarithmic barrier function, the modified objective
    function becomes:

    $|F(x, c) = x^2 - c ln(1-x)|$

    As $x$ approaches 1, the logarithmic term, becomes large, penalising
    solutions near the constraint boundary. In practice, an optimisation
    algorithm would minimise $F(x, c)$ for a sequence of decreasing values of
    $c$, effectively pushing the solution towards the boundary of the feasible
    region while maintaining feasibility.

** Interior Point Methods

*** Purpose

    Algorithms for solving linear and nonlinear optimsation probems. They are
    particularly useful for large-scale optimisation problems, like linear
    programming, quadratic programming and convex optimisation.

*** How it works

    Starting from a point within the interior of the feasibly region (set) and
    iteratively moving towards the solution. This is in contrast to the methods
    like simplex algorithms that operate on boundary of the feasible region.

*** Key Features:

    - *Barrier Functions*: Interior point methods often use barrier functions
      to ensure that the iterations remain within the feasible region. The
      logarithmic barrier function is a common choice.
    - *Polynomial Time Complexity*: These methods have a polynomial time
      complexity, which can make them more efficient for certain large-scale
      problems compared to other methods like the simplex algorithm.
    - *Path-Following Algorithms*: They typically follow a path that is defined
      by a sequence of optimization problems with decreasing values of a
      parameter in the barrier function.

** Lyapunov Function

*** Definition and Purpose

    Lyapunov function is a scalar function that helps to determine stability of
    an equlibrium point in a dynamical system. The function is analogous to a
    potential energy function in physics, where its value represents a measure
    of the system's potential for change.

    They are valuable because they provide a way to prove stability without
    solving system's differential equation directly. Useful if equation is too
    complex to solve analytically.

*** Characteristics

**** Positive Definiteness

     A Lyapunov function $V(x)$ is typically required to be positive definite.
     i.e. $V(x)>0$ for all $|x \neq 0|$ and $|V(0) = 0|$. This means that the
     function has a minimum value at the equilibrium point. Kind of like a
     bowl.

**** Derivative Sign

     The derivative of the Lyapunov function along the trajectories of the
     system, $|\dot{V}(x) \leq 0|$ for all $x$ in the region of interest. This
     means that the function does not increase in value over time, suggests
     stability. 

*** Types of Stability Analysis

**** Stability

     If $|\dot{V}(x) \leq 0|$ the equilibrium point is stable. Small
     perturbations from equilibrium will not cause system to diverge
     significantly.

**** Asymptotic Stability

     If $|\dot{V}(x) < 0|$ the equilibrium is asymptotically stable.
     Perturbations will not only stay bounded but will also decay to zero over
     time.

**** Global Stability

     If Lyapunov function and its derivative conditions are valid for all $x$
     in the system, then global stability is implied, meaning the stability
     conditions hold for any initial state of the system.

** Barrier Certificates

*** Definition and Purpose

    Barrier certificate is a function $B(x)$ that separates the state space of
    a dynaical system into safe and unsafe regions. Function is constructed
    such that its level sets define a boundary between safe and unsafe states.

    They are used to certify that trajectories of the system starting from a
    safe initial condition will not enter unsafe regions over time.

*** Characteristics

**** Non-negativity

     Typically $B(x)$ is designed such that it is non-negative in the safe
     region and negative in the unsafe region.

**** Derivative Condition

     Along the trajectories of the system, the derivative of $B(x)$, denoted as
     $|\dot{B}(x)|$, must satisfy certain conditions to ensure safety. Common
     requirement is that it should be non-positive whenever $B(x)=0$. This
     ensures that the system's trajectory cannot cross from safe into unsafe
     regions.

*** Example

    Consider a simple robotic system where the goal is to ensure the robot does
    not collide with an obstacle. Let's define the state of the robot as $x$
    and the unsafe region as a particular area around the obstacle.

    A barrier certificate $B(x)$ can be designed such that the $|B(x) \geq 0|$
    represents the safe rgion (away from teh obstacle) and $|B(x)<0|$
    represents the unsafe region (close to or in the obstacle).

    If we can show that for all initial states $x_0$ in teh safe region and for
    all times $|t \geq 0, B(x(t)) \geq 0|$ holds (the certificate's value
    remains non-negative along system trajectory) then we have certified that
    the robot will not collide with the obstace.

*** Application

    Barrier certificates are used extensively in the verification of safety
    properties in autonomous systems, including robots and self-driving cars.
    They are crucial in scenarios where it is not feasible to test all possible
    trajectories for safety, which is often the case in complex or
    high-dimensional systems. By providing a mathematical proof of safety,
    barrier certificates play a vital role in the design and implementation of
    reliable and secure autonomous systems.

** Locally Lipschitz

   Refers to a property of a function in context of differential equations and
   control theory. A function $f(x)$ is said to be locally Lipschitz if, for
   every point in its domain, there exists a neighbourhood around that point
   where the function does not change too rapidly.

   In more technical terms, within this neighbourhood, the difference in the
   function's values at any two points is bounded by a constant (Lipschitz
   constant) times the distance between the two points.

   This property is important to ensure that the well-behavedness of solutions
   to differential equations and is often a requirement for applying certain
   mathematical theorems and techniques.

** Objective

   > Safety requires that "bad" things do not happen while liveness requires
   > that "good" things eventually happen.

   Asymptotic stability is an example of a liveness property since it is seen
   as "equilibrium is eventually reached".

   Usually Lyapunov functions have played a predominant role in the
   investigation of liveness properties. This paper aims to refocus the
   discussion on safety by introducing control barrier functions that play a
   role equivalent to Lyapunov functions in study of liveness property.

   Paper aims to establish basic theory of safety-critical control and
   highlight some important applications.

** Fundamentals

   Always consider a nonlinear affine control system:

   $|\dot{x} = f(x) + g(x) u|$

*** Control Lyapunov Function (CLF)

**** Definition and Purpose

     CLFs are used to ensure the stability of a system. They help in designing
     a control input that drives the system towards a desired stable state.

     A function $V(x)$ is a CLF if it satisfies all the rules as defined by a
     regular {** Lyapunov Function}[Lyapunov Function], with regards to its positive definiteness
     and negative definiteness of its derivative. 

**** Difference between CLF and regular Lyapunov Function

***** Regular LF

      Primarily used to analyse stablity of an equilibrium point of a system.
      If such a function decreases over time, it implies that the system's
      state will converge to the equilibrium, indicating stability.

      Consider simple system:
      
      $|\dot{x} = -x|$
      
      A potential LF could be 
      
      $|V(x) = \frac{1}{2} x^2|$

      Take time derivative:

      $|\dot{V}(x) = \frac{dV}{dx} \frac{dx}{dt} = x(-x) = -x^2|$ 

      It abides to all the rules of a LF. Now at $x=0$ the $|\dot{V}(x)=0|$
      thus the system is stable.

***** CLF

      Extends the concept to systems with control inputs. It is designed not
      just to assert stability but to actively guide the selection of control
      inputs that ensure the system's convergence to a stable state.
      Essentially, a CLF helps in designing a controller for stabilizing the
      system.

      For a control system described:

      $|\dot{x} = u|$

      A CLF might also be:

      $|V(x) = \frac{1}{2} x^2|$
      
      However, we can use the CLF to design a control law. For example, by
      choosing:

      $|u = -kx, k > 0|$

      We find the derivative (note that it is being done w.r.t. time variable):

      $|\dot{V}(x) = \frac{dV}{dx} \frac{dx}{dt} = x \dot{x} = x(-kx) = -kx^2|$

      Which is negative definite. Thus the control law can stabilise the system
      at $x=0$
