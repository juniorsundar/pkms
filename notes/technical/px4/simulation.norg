* Introduction

  Simulators allow PX4 flight code to control a computer modeled vehicle in a
  simulated environment, with the same level of software interactability as the
  real drone. PX4 supports both {:$/terminologies/software-in-the-loop:}[Software in the Loop] (SITL) and {:$/terminologies/hardware-in-the-loop:}[Hardware in the
  Loop] (HITL).

* Simulators

  Since the PX4 is an important component in the system's design, it is used as
  the starting point for this search. While simulation can take place with a
  wide variety of softwares and physics environments, it is best to start from
  a point where PX4 is supported out-of-the-box. PX4's dev {https://dev.px4.io/v1.11_noredirect/en/simulation/}[documentation] lists the
  following simulation options:
  ~ Gazebo
  ~ jMAVSim
  ~ FlightGear
  ~ Microsoft AirSim

** Gazebo

   /Access documentation {https://dev.px4.io/v1.11_noredirect/en/simulation/gazebo.html}[here]./

   - *Advantages*
      -- Wide variety of sensor support through plugins. Useful when use cases
         extend into sensor data streams.
      -- Able to simulate multiple vehicles at the same time. More scalable
         than the other options.
      -- Comes with ROS/ROS2 support out-of-the-box
   - *Disadvantages*
      -- Preferred if ROS is being used. Otherwise, there are cheaper
         (resource use wise) options.
      -- Less accurate (only marginally) in replicating flight behaviour.

** jMAVSim

   /Access documentation {https://dev.px4.io/v1.11_noredirect/en/simulation/jmavsim.html}[here]./

   - *Advantages*
      -- Able to simulate multiple vehicles at the same time. Most scalable as
         it is lightweight.
      -- Simulation responds appropriately to various fail conditions (GPS
         failure, {https://www.researchgate.net/publication/353541566_Experimental_Implementation_of_an_Adaptive_Digital_Autopilot}[adversarial flight conditions], etc.)
      -- Comes with ROS/ROS2 support out-of-the-box.
      -- Extremely lightweight (resource use wise).
      -- Easy to set-up.
   - *Disadvantages*
      -- No ROS 2 support. Limited out-of-the-box ROS 1 support. It is stated
         here that it is possible to set up ROS interface onboard the same way
         as with a real vehicle. No examples available, so will have to test
         this out separately.
      -- Least accurate option to replicate drone behaviour.
      -- Limited to only multi-rotor/quadrotor setups.
      -- More difficult to set-up multi-vehicle simulation than Gazebo.

** FlightGear

   /Access documentation {https://dev.px4.io/v1.11_noredirect/en/simulation/flightgear.html}[here]./

   - *Advantages*
      -- Most accurate simulator. Able to replicate weather conditions very
         close to reality.
      -- Able to simulate multiple vehicles at the same time.

   - *Disadvantages*
      -- Limited support available with ROS. No indication if there is ROS 2
         support.
      -- Very heavy in resource usage. Excessive for most application cases.
      -- Due to resource usage, there is a limit on how many drones can be
         simulated at the same time.

** Microsoft AirSim

   /Access documentation {https://dev.px4.io/v1.11_noredirect/en/simulation/airsim.html}[here]./

   - *Advantages*
      -- Built on Unreal Engine. Realistic physics simulation.
   - *Disadvantages*
      -- Limited support available with ROS. No indication if there is ROS 2
         support.
      -- No indication of support with latest Linux kernels.
      -- No support for multiple vehicle simulations at the same time.
      -- Very high resource usage.
      -- No support for multiple vehicle simulations at the same time.

* Software-in-the-Loop (SITL)

  | /Access {:$/terminologies/software-in-the-loop:}[reference]/

** Set-Up

   To run the simulations, you need to first enter the PX4-Autopilot toolchain
   directory that was cloned. This is explained in this {:$/technical/px4/px4:*** Autopilot Installation}[section].

   @code bash
   cd ./PX4-Autopilot
   @end

** Launch Simulation

   From there, we can build the code for which ever simulation environment that
   we want as long as it exists within the build tags.

   @code bash
   # For Gazebo Simulation
   make px4_sitl gz_x500

   # For jMAVSim simulation
   make px4_sitl jmavsim
   @end

   From here, in a separate terminal, if you run {:$/technical/frameworks.px4:*** QGroundControl}[QGroundControl], you should
   be able to control the drone through that.

** Low-Level Control

   The out-of-the-box set-up for SITL does not provide access to PWM inputs
   into the actuators. This is because the simulation does not have an ESC
   model. As a result direct control of the simulated motors is not possible.

   There is a repository that offers a way to achieve this low-level control:
   {https://github.com/SaxionMechatronics/px4_offboard_lowlevel}[SaxionMechatronics/px4_offboard_lowlevel]

   In this code, they are using a commonly used "quadratic approximation" that
   maps RPM to PWM:

   $| \text{PWM} = c_2 \text{RPM}^2 + c_1 \text{RPM} + c_0|$

   In this application:
   @code yaml
   # For the holybro x500
   ros__parameters:
       uav_parameters:
           mass: 2.0                  # Kg
           arm_length: 0.25             # m
           num_of_arms: 4
           inertia:                     # Kg.m^2
               x: 0.08612
               y: 0.08962
               z: 0.16088
           moment_constant: 0.016     # m
           thrust_constant: 8.54858e-06   # N.s^2/rad^2
           max_rotor_speed: 1000         # rad/s
           gravity: 9.81                # m/s^2
           omega_to_pwm_coefficient:
               x_2: 0.001142
               x_1: 0.2273
               x_0: 914.2
           PWM_MIN: 1075
           PWM_MAX: 1950
           input_scaling: 1000
           zero_position_armed: 10
   @end

* Hardware-in-the-Loop (HITL)

  | /Access {:$/terminologies/hardware-in-the-loop:}[reference]/

** Set-Up with Saluki V2

   In order to connect via ethernet, need to provide the following details for
   eth0 connection:

   > *IPv4 Method*: Manual
   > *Addresses*:
   > - *Address*: 192.168.200.100
   > - *Netmask*: 255.255.255.0
   > - *Gateway*: 192.168.200.1

   The drone should now connect to `/dev/ttyACM1` after rebooting drone. Can
   confirm in QGroundControl by connecting to that channel.

** Launch Simulation

   Then, to launch HITL, run:

   @code bash
   # From px4-firmware root
   # Confirmed to work with github.com/tiiuae/px4-firmware -b faulty-controller-hitl
   ./Tools/simulation/jmavsim/jmavsim_run.sh -q -s -d /dev/ttyACM1 -b 921600 -r 250
   @end

** Access ROS 2 Topics

   To launch the DDS-Agent for accessing ROS 2 Topics:

   @code bash
   docker pull ghcr.io/tiiuae/tii-microxrce-agent:sha-9e67fa5
   docker run -it --rm --network=host ghcr.io/tiiuae/tii-microxrce-agent:sha-9e67fa5
   @end

   Also possible to run from local installation with open-source MicroXRCE-DDS Agent:

   @code bash
   MicroXRCEAgent udp4 --port 2020 --send_port 2019 --refs ./agent.refs
   @end

   Where `agents.refs` file is defined:

   @code refs
   <profiles>
       <participant profile_name="default_xrce_participant">
           <domainId>0</domainId>
           <rtps>
               <name>default_xrce_participant</name>
           </rtps>
       </participant>
   </profiles>
   @end

** Containerised Deployment

   It is possible to deploy the simulation in a containerised environment. The
   benefit of this is that you no longer need to build or install dependencies
   in the local machine.

   Pre-requisites to this require you to clone the firmware directory:

   @code bash
   git clone --recursive git@github.com:tiiuae/px4-firmware.git -b faulty-controller
   @end

   To build and run the simulation in a container:

   @code bash
   xhost +

   docker run -it --privileged --rm \
       -v </path/to>/px4-firmware:/home/user/Firmware:rw \
       -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix:ro \
       -e DISPLAY=${DISPLAY} \
       -e LOCAL_USER_ID="$(id -u)" \
       -w /home/user/Firmware \
       --network=host  \
       --name=container_name px4io/px4-dev-simulation-jammy \
       "./Tools/simulation/sitl_docker_run.sh"
   @end

   The DDS topics can be exposed to ros2 through the same `MicroXRCEAgent` from
   before as `--network=host`.
