* Installation

  The `mavsdk-python` library can be installed through the `pip` Python module.

  @code bash
  python3 -m pip install mavsdk
  @end

  /The GitHub repository to this library can be found {https://github.com/mavlink/MAVSDK-Python}[here]./


* Tutorials and Examples

  Sample codes for usage of this library can be found in the repository under
  the {https://github.com/mavlink/MAVSDK-Python/tree/main/examples}[examples] directory.

** Boilerplate

   @code python
   import asyncio

   from mavsdk import System

   async def run():
       drone = System()
   await drone.connect(system_address="udp://:14540")

   print("Waiting for drone to connect...")
   async for state in drone.core.connection_state():
       if state.is_connected:
           print(f"-- Connected to drone!")
           break

   print("Waiting for drone to have a global position estimate...")
   async for health in drone.telemetry.health():
       if health.is_global_position_ok and health.is_home_position_ok:
           print("-- Global position estimate OK")
           break

   ## The rest of the code runs here

   ## ______________________________

   return

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       # Run the asyncio loop
       asyncio.run(run())
   @end

* Asynchronicity

  As seen in the section {:$/notes/technical/libraries.mavsdk.python:** Boilerplate}[above], the MAVSDK Python library uses asynchronous functions.
  This is primarily due to the nature of communication and control in drone
  operations.

  ~ *Non-blocking Operations* - Drone control involves a lot of real-time
    operations, like sending commands to the drone, receiving telemetry data,
    and processing sensor inputs. Async functions allow these operations to
    occur without blocking the execution of other parts of the program.
  ~ *Concurrency* - Drones need to handle multiple tasks simultaneously, such
    as flying, capturing images, and communicating with the control station.
  ~ *Network Communication* - MAVSDK is used for interacting with drones over a
    network (often wireless). Network communication is inherently asynchronous,
    as it involves waiting for responses without knowing the exact timing.
  ~ *Improved Performance* -  By using async functions, MAVSDK can manage
    multiple drones or multiple tasks for a single drone without the overhead
    of traditional multi-threading or multi-processing.
  ~ *Scalability* - Asynchronous programming provides better scalability,
    enabling MAVSDK to handle more complex operations and larger numbers of
    drones without a significant increase in resource usage.
