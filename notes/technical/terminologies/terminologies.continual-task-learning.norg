* Definition

  Continual task learning is referred to in the context of artificial
  intelligence and machine learning. It is where the model continuously learns
  or adapts to new tasks while retaining its performance on previously learned
  tasks. This contrasts with traditional machine learning methods, where model
  is trained on fixed set of tasks and may struggle to adapt to new ones
  without retaining from scratch.

  Key aspects of task learning include:
  ~ *Learning new tasks* - Model should be able to acquire new knowledge or
    skills as it is exposed to new data or tasks.
  ~ *Avoiding catastrophic forgetting* - This occurs when a model learns a new
    task at the expense of forgetting how to previously learned tasks.
    Effective continual learning models need mechanisms to retain or
    consolidate knowledge gained from past tasks.
  ~ *Transfer learning* - Knowledge gained from previous tasks can often be
    leveraged to help learn new tasks more effectively.
  ~ *Scalability and efficiency* - Model should scale and be efficient with
    growing number of tasks.
  ~ *Task identification and adaptation* - Model must identify when a task is
    different from previously encountered ones and adapt its learning strategy.
  ~ *Memory and replay mechanisms* - Some approaches use memory systems or
    replay mechanisms to store and revisit old data, which helps in retaining
    knowledge of past tasks.

  Continual task learning is particularly relevant in dynamic environments
  where the data distribution or the tasks themselves change over time. It's
  crucial in applications like robotics, where a robot might need to learn new
  skills over its operational life, or in personalized AI systems that adapt to
  the evolving preferences and needs of individual users.
