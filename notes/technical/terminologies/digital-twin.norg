* Definition

  A digital twin is a dynamic, up-to-date virtual replica of physical assets or
  systems that can be used to simulate, monitor, and analyze performance over
  time.

  This digital model is updated with real-time data, and it simulates the
  physical object's behavior in various scenarios and conditions. By
  integrating technologies like IoT (Internet of Things), AI (Artificial
  Intelligence), and big data analytics, digital twins allow for continuous
  monitoring, diagnosis, and optimization of their physical counterparts.

  They are used in various industries, such as manufacturing, healthcare, and
  urban planning, for purposes like performance analysis, predictive
  maintenance, and process optimization.
