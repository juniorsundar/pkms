* Definition

  RISC-V (pronounced "risk-five") is an open standard *Instruction Set
  architecture* (ISA) based on established *Reduced Instruction Set Computing*
  principles (RISC). Unlike most other ISA designs, RISC-V is open and freely
  available for anyone to use, which allows hardware manufacturers to build
  their processors without the costs associated with licensing proprietary ISAs
  such as ARM or x86.

  RISC-V is increasingly used in various domains, from embedded systems and IoT
  devices to servers and supercomputers, due to its flexibility,
  cost-effectiveness and growing ecosystem.

  Its development and adoption are overseen by the RISC-V International, a
  non-profit organisation dedicated to promoting the RISC-V architecture and
  its ecosystem.

* Key Features and Benefits

  ~ *Open and Free* - Specifications are available under open source licenses,
    which eliminates the need for license fees and allows for wide adoption and
    customisation by companies and individuals.
  ~ *Modular Design* - It offers a modular ISA, meaning it has a small base
    integer ISA, which can be extended with optional modules for additional
    functionality such as floating-point operations, atomic operations and
    vector operations. This modularity enables the design of specialised
    processors that cater to a wide range of applications, from embedded
    systems to high-performance computing.
  ~ *Simplicity and Efficiency* - RISC design principles emphasise simplicity
    and efficiency. This can lead to more straightforward implementation, lower
    power consumption and potentially better performance compared to complex
    ISAs.
  ~ *Wide Support and Adoption* - Open nature garners support from lots of
    stakeholders. This has led to growing ecosystem of software and hardware
    tools (compilers, OSs, and development boards),
  ~ *Customisability* - Organisations can create extensions to the RISC-V ISA
    and develop highly optimised processors for specific applications without
    compromising on the compatibility with broader RISC-V ecosystems.
