* Steps
** Understanding Basic Concepts
*** What is Networking?
    Learn what computer networking is and why itâ€™s important.

*** Types of Networks
    Understand different types of networks (e.g., LAN, WAN, MAN, PAN).

*** Network Topologies
    Familiarize yourself with basic network topologies (e.g., star, mesh, bus).

** Learn Basic Networking Terms
*** IP Addressing
    Understand what an IP address is and the difference between IPv4 and IPv6.

*** Subnetting
    Basic understanding of subnet masks and how subnetting works.

*** Protocols and Layers
    Learn about key protocols such as, OSI, TCP/IP, HTTP/HTTPS, FTP, and DNS.

** Study Networking Devices
*** Routers and Switches
    Learn what routers and switches are and their roles in networking.

*** Modems and Access Points
    Understand how modems and access points work.

*** Firewalls
    Basic understanding of firewalls and network security.

** Hands-On Practice
*** Set Up a Home Network
    Experiment with your home network, configure routers, and manage your
    Wi-Fi.

*** Networking Simulators
    Tools like Cisco Packet Tracer and GNS3 allow you to simulate networking
    environments.

*** Online Labs
    Websites like NetSimK and LabSim offer virtual labs for practice.

** Get Certified
*** Entry-Level Certifications
    Start with certifications like CompTIA Network+, Cisco CCNA, or Juniper
    JNCIA-Junos.

* What is Networking?
** Definition
   - Practice of connecting computers and other devices together to:
      -- share resources,
      -- exchange data, and
      -- communicate with each other.
   - Foundation of modern communication and data exchange.

** Key Concepts
   - *Node* - Any device connected to a network.
   - *Links* - Physical or logical connections between notes (wired or
     wireless).
   - *Data Transfer* - Sending and receiving data between nodes over a network.

** Importance
   - Resource sharing
   - Communication
   - Data exchange
   - Scalability
   - Efficiency

   ===

* Types of Networks
** Local Area Networks (LAN)
   - Networks that cover a small geographic area.
   - Eg: Single building, campus, etc.
   - Typically used for connecting PCs and workstations to share resources like
     printers and file servers

** Wide Area Networks (WAN)
   - Networks that cover a large geographic area.
   - Eg: City, country, globally, etc.
   - Internet is largest example of a WAN

** Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)
   - Network somewhere between LAN and WAN.
   - Eg: City-wide or large campus.

** Personal Area Network (PAN)
   - Small networks used for connecting device around individual person.
   - Eg: ranging few meters, single room, etc.
   - Bluetooth connections and old-school infrared.

   ===

* Network Topologies
** Star Topology
   - All nodes connected to a central hub or switch.
   - Easy to manage, but vulnerable if central hub fails.

** Mesh Topology
   - Every node connected to every other node.
   - Provides high redundancy and reliability but is complex and expensive to implement.

** Bus Topology
   - All nodes connected to a single central cable or bus.
   - Simple and cost-effective but inefficient and prone to collisions.

** Ring Topology
   - Nodes connected in a circular fashion, with each node having exactly two neighbours.
   - Data travels in one direction.
   - Efficient but suffers if single connection fails.

* Subnetting
** Definition
   - Network inside a network.
   - Subnets make networks more efficient since network traffic can travel a
     shorter distance without passing through unnecessary [[Routers]] to reach
     its destination.

** Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR)
*** Definition
    - Method of allocating IP addresses and IP routing that improves efficiency
      of IP address distribution.

*** Key Concepts and Features
    - *Variable-Length Subnet Masking (VLSM):* Allows for subnet masks of
      various length, meaning IP addresses can be assigned according needs of
      networks.
    - *CIDR Notation:* `A.B.C.D/E` --> `A.B.C.D` is IP Address and `E` is
      number of bits in network prefix.
    - *Aggregation:* Multiple IP addresses can be combined into a single
      routing entry. Reduces size of routing tables in routers.

*** Example
    - Start with network block: `192.168.1.0/24`.
    - Lets say we need *4 subnets*.
    - New Subnet Mask = Original Subnet Mask + $|\log_{2}|$ (Number of Subnets)
       -- New Subnet Mask = 24 + $|\log_{2}|$ (4)
       -- New Subnet Mask = 26
    - Dividing network block:
       -- For a `26` subnet mask, first `26` bits are for network, remaining
          are for host addresses.
       -- In IPv4 recollect that there are IPv4 per network address, that means
          for a `/26` subnet there are $|2^{(32-26)}|$ = 64 IP addresses per
          subnet.
       -- Each subnet with have 64 addresses of which 1 is for network and
          other is for broadcast (meaning 62 usable addresses).
    - Subnets:
       -- Subnet 1: `192.168.1.0/26`
          --- Network address: `192.168.1.0`
          --- Usable IP range: `192.168.1.1` to `192.168.1.62`
          --- Broadcast address: `192.168.1.63`
       -- Subnet 2: `192.168.1.64/26`
          --- Network address: `192.168.1.64`
          --- Usable IP range: `192.168.1.65` to `192.168.1.126`
          --- Broadcast address: `192.168.1.127`
       -- Subnet 3: `192.168.1.128/26`
          --- Network address: `192.168.1.128`
          --- Usable IP range: `192.168.1.129` to `192.168.1.190`
          --- Broadcast address: `192.168.1.191`
       -- Subnet 4: `192.168.1.192/26`
          --- Network address: `192.168.1.192`
          --- Usable IP range: `192.168.1.193` to `192.168.1.254`
          --- Broadcast address: `192.168.1.255`
