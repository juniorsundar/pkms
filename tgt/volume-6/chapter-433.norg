Dora was afforded free reign to explore the mansion post the owner's departure, though she was ultimately just a captive in this world of polished and ancient wood. The freedom she was afforded was all an illusion. There were rooms she wasn't allowed to enter, and she wasn't allowed to leave the premises of the mansion, not even to take a walk outside. What at first looked like a massive abode, turned into a rather claustrophobic cage the longer Dora stayed confined within its walls. Not even its majorly open-aire design that interwove the concepts of natural light and nature could liberate her from the feeling of being imprisoned. Every day, her world shrank further, and the massive room she slept in became smaller - like a cage.

Aurwen Swiftfeather, the owner of this mansion and Dora's captor, had vanished and hadn't returned for many days. And even though the mansion was by no means empty, the staff were nothing more than ghosts, gliding about silent and unchanging. Dora had begged them to talk at first, but they only stared back with blank eyes. It was only through some mild stalking and observation that made Dora realise that they couldn't inf act speak.

Day after day, she learned their silent rhythm. Food appeared, always on time, always the same perfect portions. A bowl of water, forever full. A spotless room to relieve herself, magically cleaned when she was done. And the toys … sometimes a ball, sometimes a silly stuffed mouse, and sometimes a prism that projected lights of different colours. If Dora were a few years younger, she would be totally enraptured by these items enough to occupy her for the entire day. But the novelty wore off quickly, and what she was left with now was just plain boredom.

Her life – that same breakfast, lunch and dinner, the same walk, the same nap, the same silly toys – was a numbing loop. After a week passed, it dawned on her with horrible certainty: this was how a pampered pet lived. Was she just that? A creature to be fed, watered, and entertained within these gilded walls?

As the week came to an end, Aurwen finally returned, and she returned properly miffed. Her face was scrunched up in annoyance, and her aura came off as someone ready to unload on the first person that crossed her path. Dora did not want to be that person, so she made herself scarce. The servants weren't so lucky though. The one that handed Aurwen a cup of beverage was showered in it (after the liquid had detoured through Aurwen's mouth and sprayed out of her lips). After that, he was dragged away by two of the guards that were following Aurwen for a stricter punishment, Dora assumed. Though she didn't see the servant being dragged away protest, scream or beg for mercy.

"Where's the girl!" Aurwen yelled. It wasn't a question or an inquiry, because she already knew - her mana sense targeted Dora as she was hiding behind the wall. Within seconds, the woman was standing before her. And although she was the same height as Dora, she still looked down at her with a frown the slowly dissipated into amusement. She then extended her hand and rubbed Dora's head patronisingly.

"How are you doing? Did the servants perform satsifactorily?" She asked.

Dora had never been asked such a question be
