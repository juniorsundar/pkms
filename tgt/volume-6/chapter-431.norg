Receiving confirmation of her displacement and possible estrangement did little to calm Dora's heart. Because the realization started to bear down on her with each passing second like a relentless storm cloud, darkening her thoughts and casting shadows of uncertainty over her every move. It certainly didn't help that her hyperactive imagination was running on overdrive.

At this present moment, Dora was just one breath short of hyperventilating from a full-blown panic attack. At a momentary burst of clarity, Dora had a sudden realisation - Kano. She did not find him nearby. She was certain that he was also dragged into the twisting nether that carried her to this planet. Did he survive? Was he stranded somewhere else on this planet? Question after question started to bubble up until this branch of panic merged into the main line causing her mind to nearly split with worry.
