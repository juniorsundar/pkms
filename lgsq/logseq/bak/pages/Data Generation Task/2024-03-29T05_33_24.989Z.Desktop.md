		- The goal is to generate data sets that are diverse, and sufficiently large to be able to train and test models.
		- In deployment, the experiment environment must be able to run simulations and record data *ad inifinitum* given a preset list of parameters.
		- The simulation may cycle through a preset list of movement tasks, or it may generate a randomised movement task.
		- The simulation will start and end with each iteration for thorough safety during deployment.
			- Parameters will be cleansed to remove all faults before the simulation is killed.
			- Data will be recorded in bags, and all pertinent topics will be dumped.
			- ULOG file must also be copied over.
			- Fault data must also be copied over (time of injection, type, etc.).
		- To that end, the following prerequisites are important to get fully set up:
			- ROS bags being recorded as `.mcap` files and being dumped somewhere safe.
			- ROS nodes to initiate rosbag records when trigger is received.
			- Mission controller node to handle generating executing missions.
			- Fault handler to trigger and record faults.
			- Drone state monitor that checks if the drone is functioning. If crash, then crash time needs to be recorded.
		- **How to handle when the mission starts and finishes?**
			- This is necessary for segregating the bag files, and also to manage the sequencing for continuous mission records.
			- #+BEGIN_TIP
			  We could use the termination of the mission thread to signify a end of mission.
			  #+END_TIP
			- #+BEGIN_TIP
			  Should we resort to end of mission in all chases? Even if there is a crash?
			  #+END_TIP
		- Mission finishes normally -->
			- run through normal cleanup sequence
			- restart simulation.
		- Drone crashes -->
			- trigger a preempt on the requesting thread
			- run cleanup sequence
			- restart simulation
