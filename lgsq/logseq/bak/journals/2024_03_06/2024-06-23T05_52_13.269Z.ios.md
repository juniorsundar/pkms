		- Sensor anomalies is kind of a misnomer because the goal is to identify more than just misbehaviour of sensors, it is more of a holistic look.
		- To that end, we need to observe more than just sensors, so exposure to all the other failure modes is also required.
		- There doesn't seem to be a need to push the simulation to the cloud. A local setup is more than sufficient. Moved to 'Action Items'.
		- Goal:
			- Generating a lot of data for publication.
			- Running in multiple scenarious with diversity as the main focus.

		- *Martin Andreoni*
			- Ticky is looking at a top down approach to objective setting. For the SRTA team, the goal is to have a demo ready (initial) by July (Q2)
			- Deadlines need to be met, with regards to the weekly reports
			- Before making submissions, make sure to proofread
			- Before sending to review, it is best to have some sort of Confluence page that discusses the achievements of the task
		- *Dania Herzolla*
			- JamLocator assumes that there is a control channel through which minimal message passing is still in place. So even if there is a disconnection by jammer, some information can still be passed around
		- *Junior Sundar*
			- Add Yashrajsinh as a collaborator in Jira tasks with him
	- **Action Items**
		- ~~Update Jira and weekly report~~
		- ~~Implement a basic ROS 2 implementation for swarm controls for Saurabh to test his algorithms~~
		- ~~Prepare logistics for updating tasks and goal given the meeting with Willian~~
			- ~~Discuss in meeting with Rayana~~
- Next: [[Mar 7th, 2024]]
