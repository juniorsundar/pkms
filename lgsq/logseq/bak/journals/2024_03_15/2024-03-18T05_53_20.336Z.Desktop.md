				- Developing a varied and diverse dataset that can capture the operation of quadcopters over normal and faulty operations.
				- The purpose is to provide a sufficiently descriptive dataset that can be used by researchers and engineers to train and test models whose use is to identify these faults in the system.

- # Journal
	- Provided some data to Samridha for Accelerometer faults with additional processed data available (from the flight controller) like velocity, orientation etc.
		- Continuous drone failure causes the simulation respawn to break at points where the parameter flushing interrupts the restart procedure.
		- Revisit the respawn procedure and fix this for the final deployment.
	- Awaiting Martin's approval to see if collected HITL data can be published (proprietary data etc.).
