		- people have so much ego...
		- Task is going to be reassigned to the "Testing and Automation Team".
		- All sub-tasks will also be reassigned.
		- Is this a good thing or bad thing?
			- On one side: I have pushed the drone assembly task as far as I can. There is nothing left to gain.
			- On other side: There is less responsibility on me.
	- **GPS spoofing**
	  collapsed:: true
		- Short meeting with Martin Saska.
		- GPS spoofing is hard to identify.
		- Using VIO (Visual SLAM/LiDAR) to generate local estimate of position,
			- Less accurate than GPS.
			- More susceptible to high errors if there aren't any visual markers (like empty white corridor).
		- Augmenting VIO and GPS with alternate methods:
			- UV based markers in drones.
			- Generate position and velocity estimate using special sensors that detect these markers.
			- Decentralised approach.
