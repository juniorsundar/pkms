	- [It isn't really necessary to use a UGV](((66582552-5811-41b1-9adf-d1f85519204f))), since it was told by Rahul that it is best to rely on the system that is being worked on rather than building for something new altogether.
	- Response from Andres Garrido about status of drone flights:
		- > Hey Junior, I am not sure if you know that there are some issues with the van and the generator so we cant go with the van to Rimah. Also we cant with the bus because the driver is not available. But I connected the drone now, and I can see on tailscale, in the FMO as well but I can read the battery voltage and the camera is not showing the image. Jose is gonna work with this after some flights with the other M690b that its working.
	- Asked Moamen Ibrahim about `mission-data-recorder` as a default:
		- > Hello Junior, sure, In fog_system it is there by default but it doesnâ€™t record anything. In sim_system is by default in data-recording branch but not others. In the emulation I think it is not by default.
	- Samridha needed a method to obtain rosbag files from the test flights at
	  F4F. --> [Task](((665da005-9bef-47aa-85c8-06f126ad0a08)))

		- *Questions:*
		  collapsed:: true
			- Is the following 1D sensor case feasible:
			  collapsed:: true
				- ```cpp
				  std::vector<double> sensor_vector{static_cast<double>(ekf_1.x),
				                                    static_cast<double>(ekf_1.vx),
				                                    static_cast<double>(ekf_2.x),
				                                    static_cast<double>(ekf_2.vx)};
				  ```
			- Verify [this equation](((665a0dc2-ee9a-4ccf-81b9-6e15aeac06c5))).
			- Clarify function of `nchoosek`.
			- Are we essentially overwriting the `O_Gamma` and `Y_Gamma` in `secure_state_estimator.m`?
			  collapsed:: true
				- ```MATLAB
				  for i = 1:size(comb,1)
				      % prepare all matrices
				      Gamma = comb(i,:);
				      O_Gamma = zeros((p-s)*n,n);
				      Y_Gamma = zeros((p-s)*n,1);
				  
				      for j = 1:size(Gamma,2)
				          sensor_ind = Gamma(j);
				          O = Oi_cell{sensor_ind};
				          Y_tilde = y_vec(sensor_ind,t-n+1:t);
				          O_Gamma(n*(j-1)+1:n*j,:) = O;  %% THIS PART IN PARTICULAR
				          Y = Y_tilde' - Fi_cell{sensor_ind}*reshape(u_vec(:,t-n+1:t),[],1);
				          Y_Gamma(n*(j-1)+1:n*j,1) = Y;
				      end
				      % least square solution
				      % suppress warning
				      warning('off', 'MATLAB:rankDeficientMatrix')
				      x0_gamma = O_Gamma\Y_Gamma;
				        
				      % threshold compare
				      if norm(Y_Gamma - O_Gamma*x0_gamma)>0.001
				          % disp(['No initial state for sensors ' num2str(Gamma) '!']);  
				          % disp(['fitting error->' num2str(norm(Y_Gamma - O_Gamma*x0_gamma)) ', fail to convince'])
				      else
				          % disp(['Found initial state for sensors ' num2str(Gamma) ' at time ' num2str(t) '!']);
				          % disp('The possible x0 is ')
				          % disp(num2str(x0_gamma))
				          Gamma_set_new(end+1,:) = Gamma;
				  
				          if rank(O_Gamma)<n
				              % null space
				              A_gamma = null(O_Gamma,1e-4);
				          else
				              A_gamma = 0;
				          end
				  
				          x0_prob.x0 = x0_gamma;
				          x0_prob.A_gamma = A_gamma;
				          x0_prob.Gamma = Gamma;
				          X0_cell{end+1} = x0_prob;
				      end
				  end
				  ```
			- Clarify this chunk of code in `secure_state_estimator.m`:
			  collapsed:: true
				- ```MATLAB
				  % now check if subspac:kernal of O_G must be a subset of kernal of HA^t
				  if norm(A_x0)>0.1
				      for j = 1:size(A_x0,2)
				          M = [H; H*A; H*A^2; H*A^3]*A_x0(:,j);
				          if norm(M)>=0.0001
				              error(['possible subspace ' num2str(A_x0(:,j)') ' is not in safe set']);
				          end
				      end
				  
				      A_xt(:,j) = H*A^3*A_x0(:,j);
				  end
				  ```
		- *Responses:*
		  collapsed:: true
			- Assume at most how many sensors are being attacked (this is a prerequisite)!!
			- As for input vectors:
				- First open-loop
				- Second closed-loop --> Assume that a sensor is "trustworthy" -> In what sense? Doesn't really matter because we can guarantee stability.
				- Maybe we can use ML to identify attacked sensor to place trustworthy label.
			- What could go wrong with this implementation:
				- measurement from EKF may not be accurate.
				- model is very simple, may not be the true model, tuning may be required here.
