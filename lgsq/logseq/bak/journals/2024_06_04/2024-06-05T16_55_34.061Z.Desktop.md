	- According to Andres:
		- Siyi camera not supported in 12.0.1
		- There were some issues with PX4 firmware version and release version not matching up
		- It seems that F4F is using BKC (Best Known Configuration) 12.1, which supports Siyi Camera
			- This requires a set up of a rugged-laptop which in and of itself is a long-winded setup process
	- Since the purpose of the demo is not to run the image segmentation, we can get away with using a downgraded version (approved by Martin)

	- Need to switch from `g++` -> `clang++`
	- ```bash
	  # https://www.reddit.com/r/ROS/comments/15yr1zm/ros_c_coding_setup/
	  export CC=clang
	  export CXX=clang++
	  export CLANG_BASE="--build-base build_clang --install-base install_clang"
	  export BUILD_ARGS="--symlink-install ${CLANG_BASE} --cmake-args -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON"
	  alias cb="colcon build ${BUILD_ARGS}"
	  ```
	- The `compile_commands.json` is stored inside `/build_clang`, which can be symlink'd with:
	- ```bash
	  ln -s build_clang/compile_commands.json ./compile_commands.json
	  ```

	  collapsed:: true
		- Release 12 in FMO v.4 issue
			- Device not showing up on FMO (some IP conflicts)
			- Battery and power not showing up on FMO (also GPS)
			- Either downgrade or diagnose and resolve
			- Video feed not showing from camera
		- M690b issues popping up with PX4
			- MicroXRCE Agent not stable --> not all telemetry data visible
			- If battery status is not active, then none of the telem datas will show
		- SRTA
			- Can work with QGC but not FMO
			- If a different release works, then why not downgrade to that?
	- **Action Points**
