		- The axe, which belongs to Rama, is now tethered to Kratos.
		- Kratos is unaware of this tethering.
		- Rama does not reveal this information to Kratos.
		- Rama decides to celebrate but doesn't reveal the cause of the celebration.
			- To celebrate, Rama decides to satisfy one of Kratos' long-standing wishes: to eat meat.
			- Despite being a pure vegetarian, Rama recruits a local hunter.
			- The hunter helps capture, treat, and cook a venison curry.
			- Rama also brings out a pot of ((6660bda5-ad5c-4d2f-81b8-fb69f0f36a1e))
		- Although apprehensive, Kratos overlooks the oddity and indulges in the food and drink.
		- The Soma lulls Kratos to sleep.
	- [ ] **Kratos' dream and Rama's disappearance**
		- Shared dream that belongs to Rama
		- The dream is in first-person perspective, but it is evident from the very first frame that it isn't something Kratos has experienced before.
		- It starts with Kratos, or whoever he is in the dream, facing off against a massive army.
			- The attire, armor, and weapons adorned by the army do not match the Greek sensibility but appear closer to the land he is inhabiting now, with armor in the style of Hindu mythology.
		- A man from the army, possibly the general, explodes loudly with a sneer, saying, "You're seeking death."
			- The general stands at the back of the army on a massive chariot pulled by five or six horses, wearing extravagant armor with gold and gem inlays.
		- Kratos feels himself being drowned in a tsunami of anger and rage, something Kratos is familiar with.
		- Instead of engaging in direct combat, Kratos invokes the Brahmastra.
			- The sky darkens, and the atmosphere becomes charged with intense, ominous energy.
			- Kratos releases the Brahmastra, causing a massive explosion that engulfs the army in a searing inferno.
			- The ground trembles, creating a vast crater and flattening everything in its path, incinerating soldiers and obliterating the crescent formation.
			- Amidst the devastation, the general miraculously survives, lying dazed but alive with his chariot overturned.
