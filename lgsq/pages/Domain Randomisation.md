# Introduction
	- Popular technique for improving domain transfer, often used in zero-shot setting when the target domain is unknown or cannot easily be used for training.
	- ## Zero-Shot Domain Transfer
		- Policy is learned in a source domain and is then tested *without finetuning* in a previously unseen target domain.
		- Useful when task in target domain is:
			- inaccessible,
			- complex, or
			- expensive
	- An ideal agent learns to generalise across domains.
	- DR uniformly randomises environment parameters (i.e. friction, torque) in predefined ranges after every training episode.
	- It is hoped that by randomising every current present variable that is shared with target environment, agent will view target domain as just another variation.
	- Sample complexity grows exponentially with number of randomisation parameters.
- # Methodology
	- **Simulators:** Domain randomization uses simulation environments where elements can be modified easily.
	- **Randomized Parameters:** Key parameters within the simulation that affect the model's learning are randomized. These could include:
		- *Visual* - Lighting, textures, object colors, camera angles, background clutter
		- *Physics* -  Friction, gravity, object mass, motor strengths
		- *Task* - Goal positions, object configurations
	- **Model Training:** The machine learning model (like a robotic control system) is trained repeatedly over many iterations of the simulation, each iteration presenting a different randomized combination of parameters.
- # Importance
	- **The "Reality Gap":** Machine learning models trained solely on perfect simulation data often fail when placed in the messy, unpredictable real world.
	- **Closing the Gap:** Domain randomization forces the model to learn the core features and principles of a task independent of the specifics of a single environment.
	- **Safer, Faster Learning:**  Training directly in the real world for things like robotics can be expensive, slow, and potentially dangerous.
- # Example - Robotics
	- Imagine training a robotic arm to grasp objects. Domain randomization might involve:
		- Changing the textures and colors of the objects
		- Randomly placing objects within its reach
		- Altering lighting conditions in the simulation
		- Slightly modifying the simulated friction of the arm joints or strength of the gripper
