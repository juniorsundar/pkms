	- API is a set of definitions and protocols for building and integrating application software. It is referred to as a contract between an **information provider** and **information user**:
		- Call - establishes content required from consumer.
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Response - content required by the producer.
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- Think of an API as a mediator between the users or clients and the resources or web services they want to get. It’s also a way for an organization to share resources and information while maintaining security, control, and authentication—determining who gets access to what.
