- # Summary
	- Focuses on "sensor failure"
	- Biomisa Arducopter Sensory Critique (BASiC) dataset for UAV sensor failure analysis:
		- 70 autonomous flight data spanning 7 hours 21 minutes
		- 3 hours 2 minutes of pre-failure and 3 hours 15 mintues of post-failure data
		- 1 hour 4 minutes of no-failure data
		- [Raw Data](https://zenodo.org/records/8199999)
		- [Original Dataset](https://zenodo.org/records/8195068)
	- Performed in SITL with parameters to trigger faults.
	- Diversity of Sensor Failure Scenarios
		- GPS -> Shut off
		- Remote control -> Shut off
		- Accelerometer -> Shut off
		- Gyroscope -> Shut off
		- Compass -> Shut off
		- Barometer -> Shut off
	- **Processing Data**:
		- Each message type is represented by a distinct CSV file with _enhanced_ attribute names.
		- Attribute standardisation introduces "Status" attribute (binary) when any failure occurs during flight.
		- Data is time-indexed.
		- Missing values are interpolated.
		- Columns are structured systematically.
	- **Data Formats:**
		- Dataflash binary logs
			- On-board memory of Arducopter firmware without preprocessing.
			- Mission Planner, MAVExplorer, UAV LogViewer, QGroundControl, or Dronee Plotter.
		- Dataflash text logs
			- Converted to `.csv` from binary logs.
		- Processed data
			- Time-serialising
			- Data-smooting
			- Linear interpolations to fill missing values for a smooth spatio-temporal dataset
		- MATLAB `.mat` files
		- Raw data logs (rlogs)
		- Telemetry logs
- # Experimental Design, Materials and Methods
	- Ardupilot firmware modified with parameters that trigger faults in sensor modules
	- The method is to disable the sensor altogether with a parameter like `SIM_GPS_DISABLE` and setting it to one through MAVProxy
	- Logistics:
		- 10 different flight locations with unique mission
		- 7 flights within each location with six sensor failures and one control
- # Evaluation
	- SITL means behaviour is model not always real.
	- Ardupilot was the platform of choice. Others are opined but not attempted.
	- Individual sensor failures, not combined or multiple.
