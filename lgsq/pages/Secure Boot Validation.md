# Definition
	- Secure Boot validation is a security mechanism found in modern computers that helps ensure your system only starts up using trusted software.
- # How it Works
	- **UEFI Firmware** - Secure Boot is built into a computer's UEFI firmware (the modern replacement for the traditional BIOS).
	- **Digital Signatures** - Components involved in the boot process (firmware drivers, bootloaders, operating system kernel) are cryptographically signed with digital certificates from trusted vendors or manufacturers.
	- **Trust Database** - The UEFI firmware contains a database of these trusted signatures.
	- **Boot Sequence Check** - During startup, the UEFI firmware verifies the signature of each component in the boot chain. If a signature doesn't match or isn't trusted, the boot process is halted.
- # Purpose
	- **Protection Against Malware** - Secure Boot aims to prevent low-level malware, like rootkits, from tampering with the boot process. This malware often tries to gain control of the system very early, even before your full operating system and antivirus have loaded.
	- **Chain of Trust** - Enforces a chain of trust, guaranteeing that only software authorized by the device manufacturer or operating system provider can be loaded. This strengthens system integrity.
- # Considerations
	- **Operating System Compatibility** - Most modern operating systems (Windows, major Linux distributions) support Secure Boot. For older operating systems, you might need to disable Secure Boot.
	- **Custom Software or Drivers** - If you install custom software or unsigned drivers, they might be blocked by Secure Boot. Usually, options exist to disable Secure Boot or manually add authorized signatures to the firmware's database.
- # Benefits
	- **Improved Security** - Reduces the risk of unauthorized code or malware taking control during the boot process.
	- **System Integrity** - Helps ensure that the software running on your computer is exactly the software intended by the vendor or manufacturer.
- # Process
	- ## Digital Signatures
		- **Asymmetric Cryptography** - Secure Boot primarily employs asymmetric cryptography (also known as public-key cryptography). This involves two keys:
			- *Private Key* - Kept secret by the entity signing a component (e.g., Microsoft, hardware vendor).
			- *Public Key* - Embedded in the UEFI firmware's database, accessible to everyone.
	- ## Signing
		- The holder of the private key uses it to digitally "sign" a piece of software (e.g., bootloader, OS kernel). This involves:
		- **Hashing** - Creating a unique fingerprint (hash) of the software.
		- **Encryption** - Encrypting the hash with the private key. This becomes the digital signature.
	- ## Verification
		- During the boot process, the UEFI firmware:
			- Calculates the hash of the software component it's about to load. Uses the corresponding public key (from its database) to decrypt the digital signature attached to the software.
			- Compares the decrypted hash with the freshly calculated hash.
	- ## Success or Failure
		- **Match** - If the hashes match, the signature is verified. This confirms:
			- *Authenticity* - The software truly came from the entity who signed it.
			- *Integrity* - The software hasn't been tampered with since signing.
		- **Mismatch** - The signature is invalid, and Secure Boot likely blocks execution.
