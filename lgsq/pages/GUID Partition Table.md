# Prerequisites
	- **Globally Unique Identifier (GUID)** is a 128-bit number used to identify information in computer systems. In other contexts, they are also known as **Universally Unique Identifiers (UUID)**. Their purpose is to be unique across all space and time, making it extremely unlikely that the same identifier will be generated by anyone else.
	- GUIDs are used in software development for various purposes, such as identifying software components, ensuring uniqueness in database keys, and more.
	- GUIDs are typically represented as a string of hexadecimal digits, divided into five groups, such as 3F2504E0-4F89-11D3-9A0C-0305E82C3301. This format ensures a high probability of uniqueness due to its vast range of possible values.
- # Definition
	- Standard layout of partition table on a physical storage device used in a desktop or server PC, such as hard disk drive or solid-state drive, using GUIDs.
	- GPT is part of the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) standard, a replacement for the older Master Boot Record (MBR) partitioning scheme used by BIOS systems.
	- GPT's design and capabilities make it the preferred choice for modern computing environments, offering greater flexibility, reliability, and support for future hardware advancements.
- # Key Features
	- **Increased Partition Limit** - Unlike MBR which is limited to 4, GPT allows for a theoretically unlimited partitions (typically capped at 128)
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- **Larger Disk Support** - Supports disks up to 9.4 ZB (Zettabytes), whereas  MBR is limited to 2 TB due to its use of 32-bit fields for storing sector addresses. This makes GPT more suitable for modern large-capacity drives.
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- **Improved Data Integrity** - Includes cyclic redundancy checks (CRC) values to check integrity of its data. This can help detect errors that might corrupt the partition table.
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- **Backup Partition Tables** - Stores both primary and backup partition tables, one at the beginning and one at the end of the disk as a redundancy case of corruption.
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- **Compatibility** - A protective MBR is located in the first sector of the GPT disk for legacy software compatibility. But it does not contain valid partition information like traditional MBR does.
