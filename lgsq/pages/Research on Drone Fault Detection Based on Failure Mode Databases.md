- # Summary
	- Proposes a fault detection method based on a fault mode database and runtime verification.
	- Large body of historical fault information is analysed to generate summary of fault modes, including fault modes at the system level.
	- Monitor generation algorithm and code instrumentation framework designed to monitor whether a certain safety attribute is violated during operation of a UAV in real time.
- # Evaluation
	- This is a *formal verification* based solution to failure mode detection and recovery.
