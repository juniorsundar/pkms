	- **Attendees**
		- Xiao Tan
		- Junior Sundar
		- Martin Andreoni
		- Willian Lunardi
	- **Goal**
		- Receive feedback and opinion on the rough implementation of the external EKF, Attacker and Controller
	- **Agenda**
		- Feedback
		- Next steps
	- **Minutes**
		- Xiao wants the controller to only receive the attacked signal, not both the attacked and the ground truth.
		- Rather than sending the `px4_msgs/msg/VehicleLocalPosition` values to the controller, we want to send a custom message type that carries a different set of data inside it.
		- Possibly, a matrix?
