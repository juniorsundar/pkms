- # SRTA / Testing Team - Data Collection Discussion
  collapsed:: true
	- **Attendees**
		- Junior Sundar
		- Willian Lunardi
		- Martin Andreoni
		- Jose Segovia
	- **Goal**
		- Follow up on earlier meeting where I wasn't present, about the data collection and accumulation strategy
	- **Agenda**
		- Check how and what data can be collected
		- Identify ways in which SRTA team can coordinate with Testing Team to get the required data sets
	- **Minutes**
		- 9 features of which 2 are being demo'd for Q2 (June)
		- Single drone data collection is all that is required (not swarm)
		- Possible to schedule a workshop to teach drone flight and data collection process
		- Fleet is of non-homogeneous frames
		- Current Testing Team strategy is not standardised or logged properly
		- Some failures can occur in which the sensor cannot detect the failure happening like spontaneous disconnection of FC power supply due to excessive vibrations
		- Brought up the point of `SDLOG_PROFILE` and data collection in FIFO. It seems that it is possible but some discussion needs to take place for this. [Parameter Reference](https://docs.px4.io/v1.12/en/advanced_config/parameter_reference.html#SDLOG_PROFILE)
	- **Action Items**
		- TODO Meetup with Eyad Shaklab in Testing Team to understand data collection procedure

			- TODO Compare FIFO vs. High Rate recording: Is it possible to record this consistently?
			- TODO Coordinate with Willian and Jose to streamline data collection procedure in Testing Team's work pipeline
