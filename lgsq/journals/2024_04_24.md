	- **Attendees**
		- Jose Segovia
		- Junior Sundar
		- Samridha Shreshta
		- Saeed Alseiari
		- Willian Lunardi
	- **Goal**
		- Provide update to Jose on the hardware requirements for the Q2 Demo
	- **Agenda**
		- Point to Confluence page
		- Propose requirements for additional data streams
	- **Minutes**
		- Autonomous flights can be run in the outdoor arena with $\pm$2cm
		- Hardware for data recording needs to be synchronised with the demo builds
		- There is no temperature sensor in the battery:
			- Supplier asked for a custom power distribution board, and this does not support temperature readings
			- Possibly attach thermocouple to the batteries, but not feasible because:
				- if connect to FC, then a driver needs to be built for it
				- if connect to MC, then the OS is hardened and denies random external connections
				- a PDF that accommodates temperature stream will be required and that takes too long.
		- GPU enabling is an issue since running ML models requires GPU resources and existing
		- Barometer has ambient temperature reading (Informed Shamsa about this)
	- **Action Items**
		- DOING Data collection from testing team follow-up --> Awaiting Tintu's go-ahead

			- TODO How is the data being recorded?
				- It is known that the data is being dumped in ROSbags somewhere, how to extract this?
				- Is recording happening continuously or is it to be triggered?
