	  collapsed:: true
		- Autonomous flights can be run in the outdoor arena with $\pm$2cm
		- Hardware for data recording needs to be synchronised with the demo builds
		- There is no temperature sensor in the battery:
			- Supplier asked for a custom power distribution board, and this does not support temperature readings
			- Possibly attach thermocouple to the batteries, but not feasible because:
				- if connect to FC, then a driver needs to be built for it
				- if connect to MC, then the OS is hardened and denies random external connections
				- a PDF that accommodates temperature stream will be required and that takes too long.
		- GPU enabling is an issue since running ML models requires GPU resources and existing
		- Barometer has ambient temperature reading (Informed Shamsa about this)

	- **Goal**
	  collapsed:: true
		- Update on MLOps work
	- **Agenda**
	  collapsed:: true
		- Understand the scope of the demo for Q2
		- Resolve some of the questions regarding the image segmentation work
	- **Minutes**
	  collapsed:: true
		- Using fog-ros base image to build containers as it is yocto build ready
		- Currently not possible to access GPU resources as the `ghaf` platform is hardened AF
		- Apparently GPU enabling is not priority for the `ghaf` team
		- Safe landing and image segmentation cannot be demoed IRL if that is the case
			- Most likely will be in simulation form with dronsole
			- This just sounds pointless, but it is sufficient to produce MVOutput
	- **Action Items**
	  collapsed:: true
		- Follow up with `ghaf` team about being more involved in their team meetings

	- The 4th industrial revolution is the age of cyber physical systems. Everything is "smart":
		- cars
		- homes
		- farms
		- etc...
	- Trends for the internet:
		- Ubiquity
		- Diversity
		- Big data
	- Attackers exploit trends of internet for their own advantage.
	- [Mirai DDoS attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirai_(malware)) on Dyn Server @2016
		- Based on IoT devices connected to the internet.
		- Hacked CCTV cameras to launch DDoS.
	- With more edge devices nowadays, vulnerabilities are amplified.
	- What is a [[Botnet]]?
		- {{embed [[botnet]]}}
	- DDoS is one of the top five attacks nowadays.
	- Many IoT devices enter market nowadays without sufficient security in place
	- Botnets are conventional attack vector nowadays.
	- Conventional vs. Mobile botnets:
		- Diversity | Can exist in manyu forms
		- Quantity | Are multiple
		- Mobility | By nature of devices it infects
	- Cybersecurity mostly works with unstructured data.
	- When attackers want to initiate DDoS, they maximise data use per packet and send more and more packets per second.
	- Detecting botnets autonomously using AutoML.
	- ## Security Intelligence
		- Information relevant to protect against external and internal threats + the tools, processes and policies designed to gather and analyse the information.
		- Must be continuous, adaptive and evolving.
	- ## Defense Lines at Time of Cyberattacks
		- Preventative/Predictive
		- Reactive
		- Tolerance
	- ## Challenges and Approaches
		- | CHALLENGES | APPROACHES |
		  |----------------|----------------|
		  | Diversity of detection models | Protocol diversity |
		  | Parameter calibration | Unbalanced data |
		  | Solution management deployment | Architecture type |
		  | | Data preprocessing |
	- ## Final Considerations
		- Sophistication of attacks
		- DDoS attacks and botnets
		- ...
