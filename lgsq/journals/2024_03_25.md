			- Currently, the UTM team obtains weather forecast data from open-meteo.org, which as open-source API to obtain weather info provided the coordinates of the location.
			- There are limitations to this as it is not on board the drone, furthermore there is a limit to the number of API calls you can make before incurring costs.
			- On top of that, Lassi said that it won't be possible to record this with the `mission-data-recorder`
		- DOING Sync up with Martin to establish what can be gained from the event
