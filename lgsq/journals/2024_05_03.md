	  collapsed:: true
		- Wang Haoran
		- Junior Sundar
		- Willian Lunardi
		- Martin Andreoni
	- **Goal**
	  collapsed:: true
		- Find possible collaboration opportunities for swarm simulation
	- **Agenda**
	  collapsed:: true
		- How is Wang Haoran currently simulating swarms?
		- Is there a way to build on it or improve it?
	- **Minutes**
	  collapsed:: true
		- Current project: Exploring how to detect anomaly within swarms
			- Uncoordinated behaviuour
			- Weird behaviour
			- Communication problems
		- No reliable swarm algorithms
			- What about [boids](https://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/)?
		- Current implementation:
			- Docker containers connecting to single port that is where QGroundControl is attached.
			- Control individually with MAVSDK
			- Up to 4 drones at the moment.
			- Possibly design a wrapper to coordinate drone behaviour
				- API calls for control swarm
				- Swarm algorithms implemented under the hood
	- **Action Items**
	  collapsed:: true
		- LATER Obtain Documentation to set up swarm from Wang Haoran
		- LATER Research into UAV Decentralised Swarm implementations
		- LATER Search around in ARRC for work being done in decentralised control
- Next: [[May 4th, 2024]]
