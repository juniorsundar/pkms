		- Emrah and Ilkka have introduced a hack to get GPU passthrough working.
		- Passed this to Manuel, but some library dependency (libgstreamer) issue is stopping it from reaching release.
		- If we can use T-M690b for flights here over hacking Holybro-X500 it would be better.
		- RTA anomaly detection model from template --> may need to provide assistance to set up the ROS nodes for this.
		- **Safety island:** at time of total failure, have a backup working
			- for "Rabdan" SoC.
			- how to extract data at such cases?
