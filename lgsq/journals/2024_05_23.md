		- Since last Friday, Decision Engine (DE) has been merged into main branch.
		- Samridha model has been uploaded to MLFlow, ROS wrapper is currently in the works.
		- Safe landing use case:
			- Simulation use case with grass and stuff.
			- Challenging because image quality in the sim is crap.
			- Results look very noisy.
			- But good progress has been achieved, most likely that this will be the demo goal.
		- Demo overall status:
			- Sensor anomalies (IP)
			- FMO UI (IP)
			- Decision enginer (IP)
			- Segmentation (OH)
- Next: [[May 24th, 2024]]
