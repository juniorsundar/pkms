	- **Attendees**
		- Xiao Tan
		- Junior Sundar
		- Willian Lunardi
	- **Goal**
		- Follow up on previous discussion to explore scope and range of the project.
	- **Agenda**
		- Show the demonstration of the attacker to the accelerometer
		- Discuss whether this is the method required or if something new is in the works?
	- **Minutes**
		- They want to go for a simpler example use case:
			- EKF is the ground truth
			- Create a copy of the EKF and the attacker spoofs this value
			- This is then merged with GT EKF and then sent to the plant which is the drone.
		- Easier to only work in the planar case. So drone takes off and moves in the single place in some planar circuit.
		- Design of Experiment:
			- Twin of EKF, so the code can remain within the same module -> Just create a copy of the data output.
			- Online safe controller also needs to be implemented.
		- Future direction:
			- Some other work undertaken in the lab can use the results from this experiments.
			- How to fuse state estimation under sensor attacks more efficiently?
