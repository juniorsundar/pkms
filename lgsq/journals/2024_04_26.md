	- **Minutes**
		- Use NATS itself to handle the workers
		- Worker supervisor handles active/launched workers
		- It will also handle starting+killing of containers
		- Supervisor should know from fog-hyper
			- Container status
			- Manage containers --> May need to deactivate docker default relaunch
		- Is there some changes needed from how manual kill switch interacts with fog-navigation?
			- Take over => Action aborted at the moment
		- fog-navigation has fastest access to information from the PX4
		- Worker supervisor will support ROS 2 messaging
			- Build diagnostic topic from current navigation status etc.
		- In simulation
			- fog-navigation -> PX4 -> *CRASH* -> Relaunch --> Old mission persists -|
			- This problem only seems to affect fixed wings and VTOLs
			- Network isolation between devices:
				- Instead of restarting container --> kill processes that are in the entrypoints for container.
				- Like microsupervisors inside containers
				- "sounds too hacky"
	- **Action Items**
		- Where does SRTA fall in this supervisor?
			- There is some interaction wrt handoff of controls
			- More discussion on this is necessary
		- A basic mission-worker template needs to be built for others to build on top of this worker supervisor framework
