		- Tested out the process. Currently there is an issue in reading the file and converting it from `.mcap` to `.csv` or other human readable format. Currently talking with Moamen for that.
		- DONE Jot down how the mcap recording works (possibly hold a snippet)

		- Sensor anomalies is kind of a misnomer because the goal is to identify more than just misbehaviour of sensors, it is more of a holistic look.
		- To that end, we need to observe more than just sensors, so exposure to all the other failure modes is also required.
		- There doesn't seem to be a need to push the simulation to the cloud. A local setup is more than sufficient. Moved to 'Action Items'.
		- Goal:
			- Generating a lot of data for publication.
			- Running in multiple scenarious with diversity as the main focus.
	- **Action Items**
		- ~~#BRAINSTORM Data generation for publication~~
		- Dummy data set output with varying wind
		- ~~#RESEARCH Feature Importance Calculation~~
- Next: [[Mar 7th, 2024]]
