# Journal
	- Worked with Sakari to get the Saluki V3 Dev-Kit running Samridha's Anomaly Detection container.
	- Flashed the `feature/gpu-passthrough` release of `fog-hyper`.
	- Provisioned the device:
		- though the process isn't automatic as it should be,
		- had to add a few things to iptables in order to get the device to pull the right containers.
	- Pulling of containers directly into the app-vm not possible because not enough space is allocated to it.
	- Have to create symbolic links out of the app-vm into either the rest of the nvme drive or to an external USB.
		- #+BEGIN_IMPORTANT
		  If shutting down, remove the symbolic link to external USB or the system won't restart.
		  #+END_IMPORTANT
		- #+BEGIN_NOTE
		  This can be fixed by booting into the `fog-hyper` boot USB, mounting the filesystem of the nvme drives and deleting the symbolic links.
