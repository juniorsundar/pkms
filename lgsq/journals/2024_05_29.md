		- CANCELLED Test flight mission at 6AM @ [[May 30th, 2024]]
			- The GCS isn't communicating with the drone so cannot control autonomous missions with fog-system
			- QGC still works. Tie this in with --> ((66581d82-205a-4df6-9c16-f90213a69668))

		- Need to create a demo for GITEX to showcase the work done in SRTA
		- Need to decide on a robotic platform (*Possible UGV*)
			- DOING Check out whether F4F has UGV that we can use

				- [Scout Mini](https://global.agilex.ai/products/scout-mini) -> @F4F
				- [Bunker](https://global.agilex.ai/products/bunker) and [Bunker mini](https://global.agilex.ai/products/bunker-mini) -> @AD and @F4F
		- Need to find a strategy that is adjacent enough to the current platform such that the amount of changes that need to be made in the code/framework is limited.
		- Discussing possible demonstrable items:
			- in Hardware:
				- Authentication/Authorisation
					- voice recognistion,
					- text-2-speech,
					- LLM,
					- API to convert textual commands to robotics commands.
				- Parasitic load
					- Place load or some opposition on object and warning is produced.
			- in Virtual/Simulation:
				- Drone + Jammer virtual demonstration
					- Person designates jam region on screen
					- Drone visually deploy the geofence
					- Drones avoid this geofence
				- Mission success forecast
					- Place waypoints and forecast is shown.
					- Change waypoints and it gets updated.
- Next: [[May 30th, 2024]]
