			- What changes need to be made in the drone?
				- Anticipated: Power distribution board -> *Same with splitter*
				- Necessary: Cabling -> *for Siyi you need the ethernet*
			- Do we need any additional devices to set up the ecosystem?
				- Mesh network requirements? -> *Comms Module on Router*
				- Verify if the network configurations are correct! -> *Same as instructions*
		- Software
		  id:: ea169375-56f4-42b5-9326-3f7dea284688
			- Comms Module:
				- Image on drone and PMC -> *Same*
				- Is there any additional configuration that needs to be done inside? -> *Just in PMC and Router*
			- BKC 12.1 Release:
				- Access to release tag? -> *Available `feature/swarm-support-12.1`*
				- Changes in installation procedure? -> *No*
			- Authentication:
				- Is provisioning the same? -> *Server*
				- What is NATS TLS "enforced" vs. "unavailable"? -> *Use UAE Setup*
					- [Check here](https://ssrc.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DRON/pages/949026896/BKC+12.1#Repository-Branches-(Temporary)%2F)
		- You do need a CM connected to the Router providing internet.
		- Only the PMC and router Bridge IP needs to be edited.
		- NATS TLS -> follow the UAE installation instructions.
		- For Weights-Attached -> Rocks in a Bag with Duct Tape and Zipties.
