		- ROSBag collection from FMO WIP
		- Rugged laptop
			- Setup is difficult for testing team, need some assistance for it.
			- This isn't something I want to take responsibility on -> Handover to Martin
		- About SRTA
			- 12.0.1 in use -> Why not BKC 12.1?
				- Lack of clarity at setup phase (people be ignoring and passing the buck).
				- Camera doesn't work in 12.0.1, but I didn't know that. I asked, but again... people be passing the buck!
			- Saluki V3 some failure issues:
				- Apparently the internal sensors and ESC cannot synchronise with such high speed manouvres.
				- They don't test them in these kind of scenarios. So best to avoid them.
			- Demo from Solita is slated for Simulation:
				- Segmentation and the anomaly detection.
				- Hardware and other tests is for Q3 apparently...
		- Siyi A8 works on 12.1 and works only over HDMI in 12.0.2 and 12.0.3.
